There are 3 sequence types:
1. Random - default
2. daily
3. custom (I don't know what custom could be yet, but soon enough.)

Object ID contains: created time, machine id, process id, auto increasement option

Why I use Increase ID on Quote but not on others?
When generating quote sequence, it will store a sequence of quotes. At most the whole database of quotes. (2128 quotes).
If I were decided to store using objectID, it would be horribly heavy (I think)

Why tags don't have increase ID?
One quote can have max 5 tags. Storing as ObjectID is fine

Why creating language schema?
You cant store object inside an object, so you created a schema, then inherit the new schema in an old schema 

Does session kept when program is down
No. Session gonna dropped

Why did I decided to give 1 user only 1 email?
Cause it serves as Identity. And if there are multiple emails, what happen if the sub-email get signed up? Where do you login to? Main email account?
